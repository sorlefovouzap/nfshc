Smwea began her online journey in 2017, initially creating cosplay and gaming-related content. Her content gradually evolved, becoming increasingly sexually suggestive. She gained initial attention through Twitch streams and Instagram posts featuring provocative imagery and suggestive commentary. Smwea has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
